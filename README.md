**BookBazar - Online Bookstore Platform**
**📖 Project Overview**
BookBazar is a modern online bookstore built using a microservices architecture, combining MVC (Model-View-Controller) for the frontend and Web API for backend services. The system is designed for scalability, maintainability, and high performance, with each service handling a specific business domain.

**🚀 Key Features**
✅ Microservices Architecture – Decoupled services for better scalability and maintainability
✅ User Authentication & Authorization – JWT-based secure login/registration
✅ Book Catalog & Search – Browse, filter, and search books
✅ Shopping Cart & Checkout – Add books, manage cart, and place orders
✅ Order Management – Track orders, view history, and manage payments
✅ Admin Dashboard – Manage books, users, and orders

**🛠️ Technology Stack**
🔹 Backend (Web API - Microservices)
ASP.NET Core Web API (RESTful endpoints)

Entity Framework Core (Database access)

JWT Authentication (Secure API access)

Docker (Containerization for services)

SQL Server / PostgreSQL (Database)

RabbitMQ / Azure Service Bus (Event-driven communication)

Redis (Caching for performance)

Swagger / OpenAPI (API Documentation)

**🔹 Frontend (MVC - User Interface)**
ASP.NET Core MVC (Server-side rendering)

Bootstrap 5 (Responsive UI)

JavaScript / jQuery (Dynamic interactions)

Razor Pages (Templating engine)

**🔹 DevOps & Deployment**
Docker & Docker Compose (Container orchestration)

GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps (CI/CD Pipelines)

Azure App Service / AWS ECS (Cloud deployment)
